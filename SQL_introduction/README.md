# SQL Introduction

This project introduces fundamental SQL concepts and commands using MySQL 8.0, including database and table creation, data manipulation, and queries for listing, updating, and removing data. Each SQL script is self-documented with comments and follows the required format for readability and execution.

## Usage

All scripts are written for use with MySQL 8.0+ on Ubuntu 20.04. Run each script using:

```bash
cat script_name.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p [database_name]
```

Replace `[database_name]` with the appropriate database when required.

## Tasks

- List databases
- Create and delete databases
- List tables in a database
- Create tables and insert data
- Query data with SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE
- Aggregate data and display statistics

All SQL keywords are in uppercase. Each script includes a comment describing its purpose, as per project requirements.n
